The antianomic artificial intelligence mindset.

So, we've hired a new butler, how do I really enjoy my clean house?

# The Butler Did It
What elements of work in programming build up our feeling of self-worth and purpose? What are the elements of work that we can automate away? Are there things that keep us in the "flow state" as programmers that we should keep manually doing? When we use these awesome tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, NovelAI, and others, how do we keep the things that make us feel like we're doing something meaningful that is really our own? Where is the invisible line where code ceases to be "our code" and becomes "the butler's code"?

This is the question that we must address as we move forward into the future of programming. We must ask ourselves, "What is the purpose of programming?" and "What is the purpose of the programmer?".

# The Antianomic Artificial Intelligence Mindset

What is this term "anomic"? The term used to be anomía in ancient greek and was made popular by the french sociologist Émile Durkheim in the 1800s. It denotes a sense of *lawlessness* that I think fits our new paradigm of programming. We are in the digital wild west, and the potential positives are uncountable (Anomie, 2023).

Having as many choices as we are now presented with is a double-edged sword. We have more choices than ever before, but that becomes handicapping. This is the concept of overchoice. Alvin Toffler introduced this in his work in 1970. It is the idea that having too many choices can be detrimental to our well-being. It is a concept that is very relevant to our current situation (Overchoice, 2022).


# ChatGPT and the Antianomic Artificial Intelligence Mindset

As programmers, we have an incredible amount of choice when it comes to the tools and technologies we use. We have access to an almost endless array of libraries, frameworks, and APIs that can help us automate away various tasks and streamline our workflows. But with so many options available, it can be overwhelming and confusing to decide which ones to use.

This is where the antianomic artificial intelligence mindset comes in. Instead of simply choosing the tools that seem like the most convenient or easiest to use, we should be mindful of the impact they have on our sense of purpose and self-worth as programmers. We should consider whether the tasks we are automating are truly meaningful and fulfilling, or whether they are simply menial and mundane.

By adopting this mindset, we can ensure that we are using artificial intelligence and automation in a way that helps us achieve our goals and stay engaged with our work, rather than simply outsourcing our creativity and problem-solving skills to a machine.

So, as we move forward into the future of programming, let's remember to keep an antianomic artificial intelligence mindset and strive to use these incredible tools in a way that enhances, rather than detracts from, our sense of purpose and self-worth as programmers.


# How can we own our own code?
*Graham Waters
How can we as programmers feel like our work is truly our own if we use ai technology like you are to help us write code?*

There are a few ways that programmers can feel like their work is truly their own even when using AI technology to help write code:

* Use AI as a tool, not a replacement: While AI can certainly be a powerful tool for automating certain tasks, it should not be used as a replacement for the programmer's creativity and problem-solving skills. Instead, it should be used as a way to enhance and streamline the work process.

* Understand the limitations of AI: While AI can be incredibly intelligent and capable, it is not a replacement for human intelligence and creativity. As programmers, it is important to understand the limitations of AI and not rely on it to do everything for us.

* Focus on the bigger picture: Instead of getting caught up in the details of writing code, programmers should focus on the overall goals and purpose of their work. By focusing on the bigger picture, they can feel more connected to the work and feel like it is truly their own.

* Maintain control over the code: While it may be tempting to let AI handle everything, it is important for programmers to maintain control over the code and be involved in the decision-making process. This will help them feel like they are truly a part of the project and that their work is truly their own.

By following these principles, programmers can feel like their work is truly their own even when using AI technology to help write code.
