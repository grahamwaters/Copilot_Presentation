# This function takes a string as its input, and reverses the order of the characters in the string.
# then it removes all the letters that are in prime positions in the string such as the first, third, fifth, etc.
# an example: "hello" would become "hllo" because...
# the first letter is in position 0, which is not considered a prime, so it is kept.
# the second letter is in position 1, which is not prime, so it is kept.
# the third letter is in position 2, which is prime, so it is removed.
# the fourth letter is in position 3, which is not prime, so it is kept.
# the fifth letter is in position 4, which is prime, so it is removed.
# the result is "hllo".
# The function returns the resulting string.
