# Copilot Prompting

So, copilot is trained on Codex and is most proficient in Javascript, Typescript, Python, C++, Go, Ruby, and C#.
Let's create some example prompts for copilot that illustrate some of the most applicable use-cases in typical workflows:
1. A Blank or Missing README file in a project
2. Generating Test Cases for a function
3. Writing documentation for a function
4. Connecting to an API and getting data from it
5. Creating data visualizations from data at scale
6. drafting the outline of a blog post or article about a topic

For each of these sections we will create a prompt that will be used to generate a snippet of code that will be used to solve the problem. The format we want to see is:

## A Blank or Missing README file in a project

```markdown
write the readme file for this project. The readme file should include:
- a title
- a description of the project
- a list of the technologies used in the project
- a list of the features of the project
- a list of the contributors to the project
- a list of the instructions for installing the project
- a list of the instructions for using the project
- a list of the instructions for contributing to the project
- a list of the instructions for testing the project
- a list of the instructions for deploying the project
- a list of the instructions for licensing the project
```

```markdown
