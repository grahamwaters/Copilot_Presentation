"""
Instructions to Copilot:
- Create a Python-Generated function that illustrates the proportion of current coders in the United States who are using GitHub Copilot.
Data to know about Copilot and use in the visualizations:
- Copilot was released: 6/29/2021, 9:26:17 AM
- According to VSCode, there are 3,450,113 installs of the extension.

From Statista:
There are 27.7 million software developers in the world as of 2023.
There are 7.5 million software developers in the United States as of 2023.
> question for copilot
- What is the proportion of current coders in the United States who are using GitHub Copilot?
> answer from copilot (generated by just typing in the question)
- (If there are 7.5 million) software developers in the United States as of 2023, and 3,450,113 installs of the extension, then the proportion of current coders in the United States who are using GitHub Copilot is 0.46 or 46%.
Let's visualize this:

Languages [1]:
- 65.36% use JavaScript as their primary coding language.
- 55.08% HTML/CSS,
- 49.43% SQL,
- 48.07% Use Python as their primary coding language.
- VSCode is a popular code editor and as of Feb. 1 2021, it had 14 million users.
