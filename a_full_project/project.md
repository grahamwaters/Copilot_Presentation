# Using Augmented Intelligence to go from an idea to a product in 4 days

## Introduction

This project goes from idea to working prototype in four days.

My idea: I wonder if I could build a recommender system for music that matches each of the the elements of a song separately and then recommends songs based on those elements. For example, if a song has a funk baseline and female vocals, and a bpm of 120, I would like to find three sets of songs that have (1) a similar baseline, (2) have female vocals, and (3) have a bpm of 120.

## Tech Stack and Tools
<!-- list the tech stack in a bullet point list with a short sentence explaining what the role of that tool will be in the process -->
* Python - for data analysis and machine learning
* Spotify API - for getting song data
* Jupyter Notebook - for data analysis and machine learning
* VSCode - for writing Python code
* Markdown - for documentation
* Pandas - for data analysis
* Seaborn - for data visualization
* Scikit-Learn - for machine learning
* Flask - for deployment



## Stage One: Brainstorming
<!-- explain how you came up with the idea and how you validated it -->
