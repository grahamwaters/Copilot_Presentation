    "    read_xlsx is a function that reads an XLSX file and returns dataframes where each sheet is a dataframe, each column of each df should be type-cast based on the values from the corresponding sheet in the second row, and the column names are in the first row. The function should save these dataframes in a folder called `extracted_dfs` with each sheet in its own folder named after the sheet's name in the file. Within these folders, the function should save the dataframe as a pickle file. The function should return a dictionary with the sheet names as keys and the dataframe information as values.\n",
