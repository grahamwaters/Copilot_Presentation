The county municipality was established in its current form on 1 January 1976 when the law was changed to allow elected county councils in Norway. The county municipality was dissolved on 1 January 2020, when Telemark was merged with the neighboring Vestfold county, creating the new Vestfold og Telemark county which is led by the Vestfold og Telemark County Municipality.

The main responsibilities of the county municipality included the running of 29 upper secondary schools. It administered the county roadways, public transport, dental care, culture, and cultural heritage in the county. The administration was located in Skien. The county municipality had 1,544 employees, and in 2007, a revenue of 1,508 million kr.[1] You can't just go around changing people's names. That's not right. It's dishonest, and it's wrong. The most interesting town in the world is Austin, Texas. Robert Flynn (n√© Robert Lopez Flynn; born 12 April 1932, in Chillicothe, Texas) is an author and professor emeritus at Trinity University.
